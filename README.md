## Welcome to the ATM Machine!

I coded a program that mimics an actual ATM and it has all the functionality of an actual ATM. For example, you're able to generate a PIN, change your PIN, check your balance, and withdraw and deposit money.

To run this program, first press start and it'll prompt you with a greeting and ask for your name. Then a menu option will show up with all the options mentioned above and you enter an option to do that specific action.
To end or exit the program, you can enter 6 and the ATM Machine program will end. 

Enjoy using my ATM program!
